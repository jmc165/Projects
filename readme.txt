Windows GitHub Client 
---------------------

Installed GitHubSetup.exe

Created a repository "Projects" and linked it to local directory C:\Projects\GitHub\Projects (working area)

Default entries .gitignore and .gitattributes created automatically.

Adding new files to the working area (ie this one, readme.txt) automatically appear as uncommited changes.
